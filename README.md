#Webpage for small mobile screen.

This webpage showcases 'Masters of Persian Music,' a renowned Persian classical music ensemble. The design follows modern web standards with a focus on responsiveness, user experience, and clean, structured layout. The goal is to present the group's members and their music journey in an engaging and informative way while adhering to modern design principles. The project utilizes Flexbox for layout management, Google Fonts for typography, and several advanced CSS features to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the page. Key design decisions include a sticky navbar that stays visible as users scroll down, ensuring easy access to all sections from any point on the page. The main content area is divided into a left column and a right column using Flexbox, making the layout responsive across different screen sizes, from mobile to large desktop views. The design also incorporates several CSS pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes, such as ::before for a gold underline effect on links, :hover for interaction effects, :focus for accessibility, and :active for a click effect. Additionally, alternating background colors on odd paragraphs and hover effects on member cards further enhance interactivity. Visual elements such as vibrant gold accents for links, subtle box shadows for member cards, and a soft background color create a visually engaging experience. Typography choices like 'Merriweather' and 'Roboto' contribute to a professional and modern aesthetic. The webpage also includes a responsive footer, centered text, and an overall balanced design. Cool features like link hover effects, interactive member card animations, and focus outlines for accessibility enhance the user experience. In conclusion, this webpage design is user-friendly, clean, and visually appealing, optimized for small mobile screen, and integrates modern web design trends to ensure a smooth and engaging experience for visitors learning about the group and their music.
